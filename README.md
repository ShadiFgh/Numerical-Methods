# Numerical-Methods

* This is a python project that checks if the given matrix is positive definite or not. If the matrix is positive definite it finds the cholesky decomposition of the matrix otherwise finds the LU decomposition using Gauss method, then solves the equation AX = b for given A and b. I implemented all of the methods without using predefined functions in python.
